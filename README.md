# TRPC-Hangout

Hello TRPC/T3 Developers! I've made a no-spam telegram group for us to hangout, share what we're building with TRPC and help each other become better at TRPC development! 

I made this because the TRPC subreddit seems dead, and there is no great avenue for developers building with TRPC to talk about the problems they might be facing, or ðŸ¤¯ aha-moments they are having with TRPC!

### Please remember: No spam, promotion or shilling. Just TRPC dev talk!

Inviting all TRPC developers to join!

Join the group here: [TRPC Telegram Group](https://t.me/+hHJc0ZK7WT8xNTFl)

Look forward to see you there!
